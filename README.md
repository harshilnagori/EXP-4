Aim

To:

    Understand how bitwise operators work in C++

    Learn how to set (turn ON) and reset (turn OFF) specific bits in a number

Objectives

ðŸ”¹ Use basic bitwise operators like &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

ðŸ”¹ Learn how to change just one bit in a number

ðŸ”¹ Understand how shifting bits left or right changes the whole value
Theory:
What Are Bitwise Operators?

Every number is made of bits (0s and 1s).

Useful when we want to control specific bits â€” like in LEDs, sensors, switches, flags, etc.
Common Bitwise Operators in C++
Operator 	Symbol 	Description
AND 	& 	Sets bit to 1 only if both bits are 1
OR 	| 	Sets bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1
XOR 	^ 	Sets bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1
NOT 	~ 	Inverts all bits (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)
Left Shift 	<< 	Shifts bits to the left, multiplying by 2
Right Shift 	>> 	Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2
Set and Reset a Bit

Sometimes, we donâ€™t want to change the whole number â€” just one single bit. It is very useful in electronics, where you control just one light or switch.
To Set a Bit (Make a bit = 1)

num | (1 << 3)

This keeps all other bits the same, and turns bit at position 3 to 1
To Reset a Bit (Make a bit = 0)

num & (~(1 << 4))

This makes the bit at position 4 = 0, and keeps the rest unchanged.
Program Description
Bitwise Operations

Take two numbers (say a = 5 and b = 3)

Apply each bitwise operator and show the result

a & b â†’ AND

a | b â†’ OR

a ^ b â†’ XOR

~a â†’ NOT

a << 1 â†’ Left shift by 1

a >> 1 â†’ Right shift by 1
Set & Reset Specific Bits

Letâ€™s say we want to set bit 2 of number a â†’ use a | (1 << 2)

To resetF bit 1 of number a â†’ use a & (~(1 << 1))

We can see that before and after values has changed just one bit.
Concepts Used

Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Set a bit: num | (1 << position)

Reset a bit: num & (~(1 << position))
